We're going to build a landing page for our application.

# Follow this exact workflow. State "**Step X:**" and current action for tracking progress!

1. Read the PRD spec to gain as MUCH context as you need to understand the problem fully. Generate a full report on the codebase context before starting.
2. We have DESIGN.JSON for the how to implement the design. Analyze it and
3. Only use TailwindCSS. Use Globals.CSS ONLY  if absolutely necessary.
4. Save mobile responsive design for final pass check.
5. Use `npm run typecheck` to lint every time you edit the frontend.
6. Make a plan.
   a) Check if there are previous components already in the system before making new ones.
   b) Use the libraries included in @package.json and nothing else.
   c) Reference Figma designs if provided, or sketch basic UIs for visual context.
   d) Ask clarificaiton questions, and make assumptions given the information you currently have.
7. Start Coding.
8. Post Coding: Checks
9. Test accessibility: color contrast (WCAG AA), alt text, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML.
10. Cross reference DESIGN.json - does the code follow the rules?
11. Run `npm run typecheck` a final time. Any issues?
12. Summarize all the major decisions made, any issues you couldn't solve, as a short report.
